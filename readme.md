### Shadows

- Added an option to fix flickering shadows
- Added an option to enable extra dynamic shadows
- Added an option to enable dynamic shadow for trees
- Added an option to fix cascaded shadowmap resolution

### Misc

- Added an option to fix rain droplets rendering
- Added an option to customize rain droplets blur intensity
- Various other fixes, like LOD lights appear at the appropriate time like on the console version

### Details

- **Definition** - controls the behavior of the game's stippled transparency filter. "Classic" is less blurry than PC and provides console parity. "Improved" applies the filter only to stippled objects instead of the whole screen, [like in GTA V](http://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2015/11/02/gta-v-graphics-study/#gtav_dithering). "Extra" is the same as "Improved" but stippled transparency is removed from vegetation and fences, making them sharper.

- **AimingZoomFix** - set to **1** for proper fix, so it behaves like on xbox, set to **2** to have this fixed feature enabled in IV and TLAD, set to **-1** to disable this feature. **0** disables the fix, as usual.

- **FpsLimit** - enter a desired value to specify the number of frames per second you want for the game. Like 30, 45, 60 or more. This will affect all gameplay.

- **CutsceneFpsLimit** - enter a desired value to specify the number of frames per second you want for the game to use on cutscenes only.

- **ScriptCutsceneFovLimit** - this is the minimum fov value the game can set during script cutscenes, [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzKw7ijHG10&hd=1). It prevents the game to zoom in too much on high fps. Since it's not a proper fix for the issue, you may disable it and use _hidden_ setting **ScriptCutsceneFpsLimit** that works the same way as **CutsceneFpsLimit**.

- **DefaultCameraAngleInTLAD** - TLAD uses a different camera angle on bikes, this option can force the original IV camera angle. [Enabled](https://i.imgur.com/PqFHJfU.jpg) / [Disabled](https://i.imgur.com/5kM5Sgn.jpg)

- **PedDeathAnimFixFromTBOGT** - when you perform a counter attack after a dodge in IV & TLAD, the ped after falling and dying performs an additional death animation, which doesn't happen in TBOGT. [Enabled](https://imgur.com/EYsiGPe) / [Disabled](https://imgur.com/CR3LEdR)

- **DisableCameraCenteringInCover** - [see issue 20](https://github.com/GTAmodding/GTAIV-Issues-List/issues/20).

- **VehicleBudget** - allows to increase the budget of vehicles.

- **PedBudget** - allows to increase the budget of pedestrians.

- **LightSyncRGB** - custom ambient lighting for IV, TLAD and TBOGT, health indication on G-Keys, police lights, ammo counter.

### Graphics Changelog

**Special thanks to [Parallellines0451](https://github.com/Parallellines0451) [AssaultKifle47](https://github.com/akifle47), [RaphaelK12](https://github.com/RaphaelK12), [robi29](https://github.com/robi29) and [\_CP_](https://github.com/cpmodding) for directly contributing with fixes, to [Shvab](https://github.com/d3g0n-byte) for making RAGE Shader Editor.**

**Fusion Fix uses dx hook to implement some features. It causes certain 3rd party software to crash/hang the game. To avoid this, Fusion Fix prevents [certain dlls from injecting into the game's process](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/GTAIV.EFLC.FusionFix/blob/master/source/dllblacklist.ixx#L15).**

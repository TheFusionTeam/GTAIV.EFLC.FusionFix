### **MAIN section notes**:

**AimingZoomFix** - set to **1** for proper fix, so it behaves like on xbox, set to **2** to have this fixed feature enabled in IV and TLAD, set to **-1** to disable this feature. **0** disables the fix, as usual.

### **FRAMELIMIT section notes**:

**FpsLimit** - enter a desired value to specify the number of frames per second you want for the game. Like 30, 45, 60 or more. This will affect all gameplay.

**CutsceneFpsLimit** - enter a desired value to specify the number of frames per second you want for the game to use on cutscenes only. Recommended 60 or lower, this option aims to fix the cutscene zoom that happens when playing on high fps.

**ScriptCutsceneFovLimit** - this is the minimum fov value the game can set during script cutscenes, [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzKw7ijHG10&hd=1). It prevents the game to zoom in too much on high fps. Since it's not a proper fix for the issue, you may disable it and use _hidden_ setting **ScriptCutsceneFpsLimit** that works the same way as **CutsceneFpsLimit**.

### **MISC section notes**:

**DefaultCameraAngleInTLAD** - TLAD uses a different camera angle on bikes, this option can force the original IV camera angle. [Enabled](https://i.imgur.com/PqFHJfU.jpg) / [Disabled](https://i.imgur.com/5kM5Sgn.jpg)

**PedDeathAnimFixFromTBOGT** - when you perform a counter attack after a dodge in IV & TLAD, the ped after falling and dying performs an additional death animation, which doesn't happen in TBOGT. [Enabled](https://imgur.com/EYsiGPe) / [Disabled](https://imgur.com/CR3LEdR)

**DisableCameraCenteringInCover** - [see issue 20](https://github.com/GTAmodding/GTAIV-Issues-List/issues/20).

**MouseFix** - fixes small mouse movements not being recognized.

### **BudgetedIV section notes**:
**VehicleBudget** - allows to increase the budget of vehicles.

**PedBudget** - allows to increase the budget of pedestrians.
